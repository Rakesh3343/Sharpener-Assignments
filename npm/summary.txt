package.json: A file that keeps track of the project's settings, dependencies, and scripts.  
nodemon: A tool that restarts the server automatically when you make code changes.  
To install nodemon globally: Use npm install -g nodemon.  
Scripts in package.json: Defined in the "scripts" section to run commands.  
Installing a regular dependency: Use npm install <package-name>.  
Dependencies vs. DevDependencies:  
Dependencies: Needed for the app to work.  
DevDependencies: Only needed during development (e.g., testing tools).  
npm install --production: Installs only production dependencies and skips dev dependencies.  
Installing a dev dependency: Use npm install <package-name> --save-dev.  
Uninstalling a package: Use npm uninstall <package-name>.  
Not a default field in package.json: "devDependencies" is not created automatically when running npm init.
